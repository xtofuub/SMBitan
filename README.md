## 🔍 What is this?

**SMB Enumerator** is a lightweight, self-hosted web application that lets you browse and interact with files on Windows network shares (UNC paths) through a clean, professional dark-themed interface. Think of it as a modern file explorer that runs in your browser.

No complicated setup. No heavy dependencies. Just connect to a UNC path and start browsing.

## Features

### File Explorer
- **Tree-based navigation** — Expand and collapse folders just like a desktop file explorer
- **UNC path support** — Connect directly to Windows network shares (e.g. `\\server\share`)
- **Auto-connect** — Pre-configured path loads automatically on startup
- **Breadcrumb navigation** — Always know where you are in the file tree

### Instant Search
- **Background indexing** — Entire file tree is indexed in-memory for near-instant search
- **Disk cache** — Index is saved to disk so reconnections are lightning-fast (24h TTL)
- **Smart filters** — Search by name or full path, filter by files/folders, toggle exact word match
- **Click to preview** — Search results open file previews directly; use the 📂 button to locate in tree

### File Preview
- **Images** — PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, BMP, SVG, ICO, TIFF, AVIF rendered inline
- **PDF documents** — Full page-by-page viewer with navigation arrows (powered by PDF.js)
- **Word documents** — `.docx` files rendered as formatted HTML (powered by mammoth.js)
- **Text & code** — Syntax-friendly display for `.txt`, `.json`, `.py`, `.js`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.md`, `.yaml`, and many more
- **Open in Browser** — Open any file directly in a new browser tab
- **Download** — One-click download for any file

### Interface
- **Dark theme** — Easy on the eyes, inspired by GitHub's dark mode
- **Animated transitions** — Smooth expand/collapse with staggered fade-in animations
- **File icons** — Visual file type indicators at a glance
- **Responsive layout** — Sidebar explorer + main preview pane

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your machine
- **Network access** to the target UNC share (e.g. `\\10.0.0.5\share`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xtofuub/SMBitan.git
cd SMBitan

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

```bash
python app.py
```

Open **http://localhost:5000** in your browser. That's it.

### Default Share Path

The app auto-connects to a pre-configured UNC path on load. To change it, edit `static/index.html` and update the `value` attribute:

```html
<input id="host" placeholder="UNC path e.g. \\\\server\\share" value="\\\\10.0.0.5\\Tekniikka" spellcheck="false">
```


Replace `\\\\10.0.0.5\\Tekniikka` with your own UNC path (double backslashes in HTML).


## Usage

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Enter a UNC path in the top bar (e.g. `\\10.0.0.5\Tekniikka`) |
| **2** | Make sure the **UNC** checkbox is enabled |
| **3** | Click **Connect** |
| **4** | Browse the file tree in the sidebar, or type in the search bar |
| **5** | Click any file to preview it in the viewer pane |

### Search Tips

- Type in the search bar to instantly search across **all** folders (even those not yet expanded)
- Use the filter buttons to narrow results:
  - **Name** / **Path** — match against file name only, or the full path
  - **All** / **Files** / **Folders** — filter by entry type
  - **Exact** — match whole words only
- Click a search result to **preview** it directly
- Click the **📂** button on a result to **navigate** to its location in the tree
